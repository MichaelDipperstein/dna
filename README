This archive contains the results of three nucleotide sequence queries
using SSEARCH, FASTA, and BLAST.  Each of the queries were made against
nucleotide data sets available from GenBank.  The data sets used were,
the E. coli data set, the yeast data set, and the homosapien chromosome
one.  The data sets were each obtained with the November 1999 updates.
